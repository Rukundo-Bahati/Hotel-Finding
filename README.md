Customization and Production

Expanding the ESLint Configuration
If you're developing a production application, we recommend updating the ESLint configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

Configure the top-level parserOptions property in .eslintrc.js to specify your TypeScript configuration.
Replace plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended with plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked or plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked.
Optionally add plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked.
Install eslint-plugin-react and add plugin:react/recommended & plugin:react/jsx-runtime to the extends list.
